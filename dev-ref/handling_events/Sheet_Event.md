title: 'Sheet Event'
---
# Overview

These events are related to sheet operation such as creating, selecting,
deleting, and renaming a sheet.

## onSheetSelect

This event is fired when a user clicks on the sheet bar to select a sheet.
When a corresponding event listener is invoked, a `io.keikai.ui.event.SheetSelectEvent` object is passed as an argument.

## onAfterSheetCreate

This event is fired after a user creates a new sheet. When a
corresponding event listener is invoked, a `io.keikai.ui.event.SheetEvent` object is passed as an argument.

## onAfterSheetNameChange

This event is fired after a user has renamed a sheet. When a
corresponding event listener is invoked, a `io.keikai.ui.event.SheetEvent` object is passed as an argument.

## onAfterSheetOrderChange

This event is fired after a user changes the order of a sheet. When a
corresponding event listener is invoked, a `io.keikai.ui.event.SheetEvent` object is passed as an argument.

## onAfterSheetDelete

This event is fired after a user deletes a sheet. When a corresponding
event listener is invoked, a `io.keikai.ui.event.SheetDeleteEvent` object is passed as an argument.

# Event Monitor Example

Below is the screenshot of [Event Monitor](Cell_Clicking_Event#event-monitor-example) for about sheet operations. You can see from the
right hand side panel that we created a "sheet3", selected it, moved it, and renamed it to "essentials", and eventually deleted it.

  - Line 4, 12, 20, 29, 41: Apply `@Listen` to listen to an event with the
    syntax `[EVENT NAME] = [COMPONENT SELECTOR]`. All event names can be
    found in `io.keikai.ui.event.Events`.
    The "\#ss" is the component selector which refers to the component with
    id "ss" on the ZUL page. (SelectorComposer supports various selector
    syntax that let you select components easily. Please refer to [ZK
    Developer Reference](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC/Controller/Wire_Components)).
