title: 'Using Official Version'
---
This section is for customers who purchased Keikai EE. To use the official version (licensed Keikai EE), you need to
1. Download official release JARs from [the keikai premium repository](https://maven.zkoss.org/repo/keikai/ee/io/keikai/)
2. Apply a license key

# Download official release JARs

## Setup Login Information
The premium repository requires authentication. Licensed customers will be given a set of username and password upon your request. According to [the official Maven doc](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html), you can specify login information in one of the following locations: (if not existed, you can create it manually)
* The Maven install: `$M2_HOME/conf/settings.xml`
* A user's install: `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`

For example:
```xml
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
        http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>Keikai EE</id><!-- Same as your repository ID -->
            <username>your-username</username> 
            <password>your-password</password> 
        </server>    
        <server>
            <id>ZK EE</id>
            <username>your-username</username> 
            <password>your-password</password> 
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

## Download with Maven
Using Maven is recommended. Specify the maven repositories for **Keikai EE** and **ZK EE** like this [pom.xml](https://github.com/keikai/dev-ref/blob/master/pom.xml).

## Download a binary zip manually
Visit[the keikai premium repository](https://maven.zkoss.org/repo/keikai/ee/io/keikai/binary/) with your browser , enter username and password. Then get the zip file like keikaiee-bin-[VERSION].zip.





# Applying a License Key
If you are a paying Keikai EE customer, you will obtain a license key after completing the purchase. Follow this section to apply the given license key to activate your Keikai EE component. There are 3 ways to apply a license key below. Choose the one that suits your environment. 

The first approach below **Use Default License Loading Path** is the easiest approach. However, if your setup does not allow the first approach, use the 2nd or 3rd approach.

## Use Default License Loading Path

Keikai loads a license file from the default path:

**`WEB-INF/classes/metainfo/keikai/license/`**

Create the path above if it does not exist, and put the license key into the path. This is the simplest way if you just have one Keikai-based web application.

## Specify an Absolute Path with a Library Property

Some application servers like WebLogic, Wildfly could fail to locate the license
file in the default path. Then you can specify the absolute path of the
license with the following library property in `zk.xml` and copy your
Keikai license file there.

```xml
<library-property>
    <name>io.keikaiex.rt.Runtime.directory</name>
    <value>c:/systemAbsolutePath/my-licenses/</value>
</library-property>
```

It's also a way that multiple Keikai-based applications can load the same license file.

## Specify the Path in a System Property

Because `Library.getProperty()` will look for a system property if no
corresponding property defined in `zk.xml`, you can also pass the
license file path to Keikai via a system property.

For example in a Tomcat, you can add a `setenv.sh` (or `setenv.bat`) that contains

```
export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -Dio.keikaiex.rt.Runtime.directory=/absolutePathToYourLicenseFilePath/"
```

Tomcat `catalina.sh` will invoke this script if exists.

Refer to your application server's documentation to set a system
property. In conclusion, you can pass the path in any way that can be
retrieved by Java's `System.getProperty()`, e.g. a system variable in
Windows.

# License Information

If the license key is loaded successfully, you should see the license
information like below printed in your application server's console when
the server starts like:

```
