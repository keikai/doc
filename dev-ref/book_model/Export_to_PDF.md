# PDF Exporter

In addition to the Excel format, you can also export a book model into a
PDF file with [`io.keikai.api.Exporter`](https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/api/Exporter.html).

**Example to export as a PDF**

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class ExportPdfComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {

    @Wire
    private Spreadsheet ss;

    Exporter exporter = Exporters.getExporter("pdf");
    
    
    @Listen("onClick = #exportPdf")
    public void doExport() throws IOException{
        Book book = ss.getBook();
        
        File file = File.createTempFile(Long.toString(System.currentTimeMillis()),"temp");
        FileOutputStream fos = null;
        try {
            fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
            exporter.export(book, file);
        }finally{
            if(fos!=null){
                fos.close();
            }
        }
        Filedownload.save(new AMedia(book.getBookName()+".pdf", "pdf", "application/pdf", file, true));
    }

    ...
}

# Export Server Setup

The default chart engine is ZK Charts. With this engine, 
exporting spreadsheets that include charts to PDF needs extra
export server chart data rendering at the server side. The easiest way
is to adopt Highcharts official solution which is based on PhantomJS, a
headless Webkit browser.

1.  download and install PhantomJS [here](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).
    
2.  download Highcharts project [here](http://www.highcharts.com/download)
    1.  in this project, go to exporting-server -\> phantomjs
3.  start export server by commanding "phantomjs highcharts-convert.js
    -host 127.0.0.1 -port 3003"
    1.  you should move the PhantomJS executable file into this folder
        1.  On Windows, the full name is phantomjs.exe
        2.  On Mac or Linux, the full name is phantomjs
    2.  you can customize host and port respectively by parameter -host
        and -port
4.  add properties into zk.xml
    1.  there are three library properties to be used

**Library properties about export server**

This is the location to export server. When it doesn't find this
definition, JFreechart will be used to generate chart graphs. (Required)

{% highlight java linenos %}

<library-property>
    <name>io.keikai.chart.render.server.url</name>
    <value>http://127.0.0.1:3003</value>
</library-property>
{% endhighlight %}

Scale is a zoom factor that affects pixel density relative to the
original, for example, 2 means double the resolution of the original.
(Optional)

{% highlight java linenos %}

<library-property>
    <name>io.keikai.chart.render.server.scale</name>
    <value>1</value>
</library-property>
{% endhighlight %}

Default timeout is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) for waiting response
from export server. (Optional)

{% highlight java linenos %}
<library-property>
    <name>io.keikai.chart.render.server.timeout</name>
    <value>10000</value>
</library-property>
{% endhighlight %}

After restarting server, ZK Charts will be shown when exporting PDF.

# Supported Excel Printing Setup


Spreadsheet exports its book model to a PDF file according to the page
print setup you specify in Excel.

![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/ExcelPageSetup.png)

For example, you can add a header and footer, and it would look like:

![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/PdfExporting-HeaderFooter.png)

You can also scale a sheet to fit into one page with row and column
heading: 

![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/PdfExporting-FitOnePage.png)
