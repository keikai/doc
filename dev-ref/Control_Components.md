title: 'Control Component'
---
# Overview
There are 2 ways to control a Keikai spreadsheet component:

1. zul attributes - static <br/>
It's written in an XML-format file.

2. calling API in a Controller - dynamic<br/>
You can create a Java controller to control Keikai dynamically by its API at the run-time.

# ZUL Attributes

Each ZK component is represented by a unique tag name, e.g. `<spreadsheet>` stands for Keikai Spreadsheet in a ZUL page. The easiest way to control a component is to specify a value at the tag's attribute in a zul. 

## Excel File Path

The simplest way to load and display an Excel file is setting `src` attribute with the file path which is a relative URI with respect to the web context root.

``` xml
<spreadsheet src="/myfile.xlsx" .../>
<spreadsheet src="/WEB-INF/myfile2.xlsx" .../>
```

- In this case, `myfile.xlsx` is under the web context root folder.
- Since Keikai runs at server-side, it can access `/WEB-INF`.

## Toolbar

The `showToolbar` attribute controls toolbar's visibility, and it only accepts boolean string.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showToolbar="true"/>
```

## Formula Bar

The `showToolbar` attribute controls formula bar's visibility, and it only accepts boolean values.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showFormulabar="true"/>
```
## Context Menu
When a user right click on a cell, Keikai pops up a context menu. The `showContextMenu` attribute controls context menu's visibility, and it only accepts boolean values.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showContextMenu="true"/>
```


## Sheet Tab

The `showSheetbar` attribute controls sheet bar's visibility, and it only accepts boolean values.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showSheetbar="true"/>
```

## Sheet Tab Context Menu
When a user right click on a sheet tab, Keikai pops up a context menu that shows sheet operations e.g. hide or move.
The `showSheetTabContextMenu` attribute controls the context menu's visibility, and it only accepts boolean values.

Default: `false`

``` xml
    <spreadsheet showSheetTabContextMenu="true"/>
```


## Selection Visibility

Default: `true`

When it's `true`, Keikai keeps the selection area visible after opening a
dialog like "Format Cell". Specify `false` to turn off this behavior.

``` xml
<spreadsheet keepCellSelection="false"  .../>
```

If you want to change the default value to `false` globally; you can do that by
setting the library property *io.keikai.ui.keepCellSelection* to
`false`. [Read more here]({{site.devref}}/Configuration#keep-cell-selection)

## Preloaded Column / Row Size

In order to speed up cell rendering, Keikai spreadsheet caches a range of
cell data at client-side to avoid constantly getting data from the server-side when
scrolling. You can adjust this range by `preloadColumnSize` (default:
40) and `preloadRowSize` (default: 60) like:

``` xml
<spreadsheet preloadColumnSize="50" preloadRowSize="50"/>
```

If you specify a larger size, it will make a more smooth scrolling when
moving to adjacent cells. On the other hand, when you scroll out of the
cached range, it takes more time for Keikai to get the next data batch from the server.

### Pasting Lots of Cells Requires Larger Preloaded Size

If you paste lots of cells from Excel which is more than cached range,
Keikai will fail to handle the pasting because it does not have corresponding
cached cell data at the client-side (you should see an error message in
the developer tool / Console tab). If you run into this issue, you should increase
preloaded row/column size according to the expected row/column size for
copy-pasting.

### Underlying Details

There are 3 ranges behind the scene:

1.  **visible range**: the viewport that shows a sheet. By default it is 40
    column \* 50 rows. It changes if you resize a browser window, or
    scrolls the page, etc.

2.  **rendered range**: the range with rendered DOM of cells.
    Spreadsheet could also render hidden rows if the next visible row is
    within the range, e.g. if row 25th\~30th are hidden, but row 31st is
    in the range, then Spreadsheet still renders row 25th\~30th but hides them.
    
3.  **cached range**: the browser cached cell data.

When the visible range moves by user scrolling, Keikai renders DOM of cells
from the cached range. So the rendered range becomes larger. If the cache does
not cover the whole visible range, Keikai will send AU request
(`onZssFetchActiveRange`) to get the data back to the cache.

## `maxRenderedCellSize`

It's a threshold to remove cached cell data when scrolling. When you
scroll toward one direction, Spreadsheet will remove cached cell data in
reversed direction. For example, if you scroll toward right (east), it
will remove those cached cells data of the left (west) which are over
the `maxRenderedCellSize` inside the "cached range" but outside of the
"visible range".

## maxVisibleColumns

Default: **>=40**

By default Keikai will detect the sheet content and show as more columns as needed. However, it will show at least 40 columns if you have a smaller sheet.


The attribute `maxVisibleColumns` controls the maximum visible number of
columns in a Spreadsheet, it must be larger than 0. For example, if you set it to 40, it will display 40 columns: column `A` to column `AN`.


## `maxVisibleRows`

Default: **>=200**

By default Keikai will detect the sheet content and show as more rows as needed. However, it will show at least 200 rows if you have a smaller sheet.

This attribute controls the maximum visible
number of rows in Spreadsheet. You can use these 2 attributes above to set up
the visible area according to your requirement.


## `columntitles`, `rowtitles`
Allow you to set custom column/row heading instead of showing A,B,C or 1,2,3.

![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/custom-heading.jpg)

```xml
<spreadsheet columntitles="Name, Age, Address" rowtitles="1st, 2nd, 3rd"/>
```

## `readOnly`
{% include version-badge.html version='5.6.0' %}

Default: **false**

Set this attribute to `true` to make a spreadsheet component read-only. All UI are disabled including the buttons on the toolbar and the context menu on the sheet tab. Users can't select any cell but view sheet content and switch among sheets.

``` xml
    <spreadsheet readOnly="true"/>
```

### Different Scope from [Protection]({{site.devref}}/book_model/Protection)
You can also make a sheet read-only by enabling the sheet protection (via UI or API), but it affects the whole book instead of a spreadsheet component. That means you affects every user who is accessing the same `Book` under collaboration mode. Hence, assuming you want some users to edit a book and some just view the content made by others, you should apply `readOnly="true"` on those view-only users.


## Other Inherited Properties

There are other properties inherited from parent component you can set,
such as `width`, or `height`. For the complete list, please look for
those inherited setter methods in the JavaDoc [`io.keikai.ui.Spreadsheet`](https://keikai.io/javadoc/latest/io/keikai/ui/Spreadsheet.html).

Each **setter** means a corresponding **attribute**, for example:

  - `setWidth()`

``` xml
<spreadsheet width="100%">
```

  - `setHeight()`

``` xml
<spreadsheet height="100%">
```

# IDE Code Completion / Content Assist
You can enable code completion of your IDE and put the schema declaration below to help you write spreadsheet attributes in a zul.
```xml
<zk xmlns="http://www.zkoss.org/2005/zul"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.zkoss.org/2005/zul http://keikai.io/2019/zul/zul.xsd">
</zk>
```
## IntelliJ IDEA
After apply the schema, click the line of `schemaLocation`. IntelliJ IDEA will show a yellow bulb and you can click it to [fetch external resource](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/referencing-xml-schemas-and-dtds.html). 

![]({{site.devref_image_folder}}/fetch-resource.png)

Then IntelliJ will download the XSD file and assist you to complete a word when you type an attribute.

# MVC in Brief

Keikai is based on ZK Framework that supports the MVC design pattern to develop a web application. This pattern divides an application into 3 parts:
**Model**, **View**, and **Controller**. The Model is the data that an
application handles. The View is the UI which indicates a ZUL page in a
ZK-based application. The Controller handles events from the UI, controls
the UI, and accesses the Model. For complete explanation, please refer
to [ZK Developer's Reference/MVC](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC).


# Controller

After we create a ZUL page, we can apply a Controller to handle events
and control components of the page. The simplest way to create a
Controller is to create a class that extends [`org.zkoss.zk.ui.select.SelectorComposer`](https://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/latest/zk/org/zkoss/zk/ui/select/SelectorComposer.html). For
details, please refer to [ZK Developer's Reference/MVC/Controller](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC/Controller).

**Controller example**

``` java
public class MyComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {
    //omitted codes...
}
```

Then we can apply this controller to a root component of a ZUL page.

**index.zul**

{% highlight java linenos %}
    <window title="My First Keikai spreadsheet Application" 
    apply="io.keikai.essential.MyComposer"
        border="normal" height="100%" width="100%">
        <spreadsheet id="ss" src="/WEB-INF/books/startzss.xlsx" .../>
    </window>
{% endhighlight %}

  - Line 2: We usually apply a controller on the root component (the
    outermost component) of a ZUL page so that we can gain control of
    all components in a page.
  - Line 4: The component's id, `ss`, can be used as a criteria in
    component selector to get Spreadsheet object in a controller and we
    will describe it in next section.

## Access Components in a ZUL Page

After applying the controller, we can easily get a component object in the
zul with the help of SelectorComposer and manipulate the component to
fulfill our business requirements.

Steps to get a component:

1.  Declare a member variable with the same type as the component you
    wish to get.
2.  Apply the annotation `@Wire` with component selector syntax which
    specifies matching criteria against the components of the page which
    is applied with this controller.

When a ZUL page is applied with a controller, ZK will *wire*
corresponding components object to those variables annotated with
`@Wire` according to component selector.

If you wish to initialize components in a Controller, you should
override `doAfterCompose()`. For complete explanation, please refer to
[ZK Developer%27s Reference/MVC/Controller/Wire
Components](https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Developer%27s_Reference/MVC/Controller/Wire_Components "wikilink").

Let's see an example to get Spreadsheet component in index.zul:

**@Wire usage**

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class MyComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {

    @Wire
    Spreadsheet ss;
    
    @Override
    public void doAfterCompose(Component comp) throws Exception {
        super.doAfterCompose(comp);  //wire variables and event listeners
        //access components after calling super.doAfterCompose()
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

  - Line 3,4: If you specify nothing in `@Wire`, ZK will use the
    variable name as a component's id to look for matching component in
    the ZUL page. In this case, ZK will try to find a Spreadsheet
    component whose id is `ss` in index.zul.
  - Line 7: Override this method to write initializing code in it.
  - Line 8: Remember to call `super.doAfterCompose()` before you
    access components because parent class wires the components for you.


## Set Spreadsheet Properties by API

After we retrieve a reference to a component, we can use its API to
manipulate a component. The basic usage is to set (or get) a component's
properties. Each Spreadsheet's property listed in previous section has a
corresponding getter and setter. For example,`setShowToolbar()` and `isShowToolbar()` corresponds to the attribute
`showToolbar`. You can read Javadoc for the complete list of getter and
setter.

**Setter usage**

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class MyComposer extends SelectorComposer<Component> {

    @Wire
    Spreadsheet ss;
    
    @Override
    public void doAfterCompose(Component comp) throws Exception {
        super.doAfterCompose(comp);  //wire components and event listeners
        //access components after calling super.doAfterCompose()
        if (isConditionOne()){
            ss.setShowToolbar(true);
            ss.setSrc("/books/firstFile.xlsx");
        }
    }

}
{% endhighlight %}

  - Line 11,12: Using API allows you to set a component dynamically upon
    different conditions.

## Handling Events

In most scenarios, the controller is usually used to listen to
interested events of Spreadsheet and implement business logic to react
to the events. When a user interacts with a Spreadsheet, it will send
various events according to his actions. Please refer to [Handling
Events]({{site.devref}}/handling_events/Handling_Events) on how you can listen events in a controller. To implement business logic,
you definitely will need to access Spreadsheet data model. Refer to
sections under [Manipulating Book Model]({{site.devref}}/book_model/Manipulating_Book_Model) to know how to use it.
