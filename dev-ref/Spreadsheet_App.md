# Overview

Keikai App is a web-based Excel like application based on the Keikai component. We created it to demonstrate Keikai's numerous powerful features. You can also use this application as a basis
of your application and add more functions like authentication.

Please follow these steps to run this application:

1.  Download Keikai spreadsheet Demo App from [Keikai Download Page](https://keikai.io/download). Depending on the features you require, choose OSE or EE evaluation version accordingly.
2.  Unzip the zip file and deploy the Spreadsheet App's WAR file to your
    application server according to its instruction.
      - For Tomcat just put the war file in `[CATALINA_HOME]\webapps`.
3.  Start your application server and connect it with your browser.
      - For Tomcat, just visit http://localhost:8080/keikai-app then you can start to experience the power of Spreadsheet App.

After you visit Spreadsheet App, you should see its user interface like
the screenshot below:

You might notice that we added a menu on top of the Spreadsheet component and enabled the 3 leftmost buttons ("New Book", "Save Book", and "Export to PDF") on the toolbar. These are application specific and we have implemented them in this Demo App. You can reference this application to implement your own.

# Features

# Configuration

## Repository Root

Cloud Drive is the folder where your files are uploaded to. Keikai Demo App will read Excel files from this folder.
You can specify the path/folder via system property.

``` xml
kkapp.repository.root
```

For example, in a Tomcat server, we can assign the following value into
TOMCAT\_HOME/conf/catalina.properties. In this case, Cloud Drive folder
will be changed to c:\kkapp\\books.

``` xml
kkapp.repository.root=c:\kkapp\\books
```

## Auto Save

Demo App supports auto save, and it is triggered in the following cases:

1.  When user changes the file content, and reaches the specified saving time.
2.  Last editing user for the book leaves the book, e.g. opens another book or
    closes the browser.
3.  When server shuts down normally.

By default, the app saves all changes every 15 minutes, but you can
change the frequency via configuration. The following example demonstrates how you can change the saving frequency to 5 minutes (300 seconds).

**Example in zk.xml**

``` xml
<library-property>
    <name>kkapp.save.period.second</name>
    <value>300</value>
</library-property>
```
